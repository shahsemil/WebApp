                    <h2>BlockChain</h2>
                    <p>A blockchain,originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, 
                        that are linked using cryptography.Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous 
                        block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).
                        By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger 
                        that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".
                        For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively 
                        adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks.</p>
                    <p> Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all 
                        subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are 
                        not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system 
                        with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and 
                        W. Scott Stornetta.[6][11] They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered 
                        with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its 
                        efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.
                        The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. 
                        Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without 
                        requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize rate with 
                        which blocks are added to the chain.[6] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core 
                        component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the 
                        network.
                        In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred 
                        on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[13] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from 
                        January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had 
                        exceeded 200 GiB by early 2020.[14]

                    <h3>How Blockchain Works</h3>
                    <p>
                        When a block stores new data it is added to the blockchain. Blockchain, as its name suggests, consists of multiple blocks strung together. In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, however, four things must happen:
                        A transaction must occur. Let’s continue with the example of your impulsive Amazon purchase. After hastily clicking through multiple checkout prompt, you go against your better judgment and make a purchase. As we discussed above, in many cases a block will group together potentially thousands of transactions, so your Amazon purchase will be packaged in the block along with other users' transaction information as well.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 three">
                    <h3>Is Blockchain Private?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Anyone can view the contents of the blockchain, but users can also opt to connect their computers to the blockchain network as nodes. 
                        In doing so, their computer receives a copy of the blockchain that is updated automatically whenever a new block is added, sort of like a Facebook News Feed that gives a live update whenever a new status is posted.
                        Each computer in the blockchain network has its own copy of the blockchain, which means that there are thousands, or in the case of Bitcoin, millions of copies of the same blockchain. Although each copy of the blockchain is identical, spreading that information across a network of computers makes the information more difficult to manipulate. With blockchain, there isn’t a single, definitive account of events that can be manipulated. Instead, a hacker would need to manipulate every copy of the blockchain on the network. This is what is meant by blockchain being a "distributed" ledger.

                            Blockchain is evolving into a more mainstream technology, and the market for the technology 
                            is growing rapidly. In 2017, the global technology market for blockchain was $339.5m. By 2021,
                            this market is projected to grow to $2.3bn It is clear many individuals and organisations from 
                            different fields are now looking at applications for blockchain that extend far beyond its origins 
                            in cryptocurrency and new financial models. Of course, banking appears to be the first major 
                            industry investing heavily in blockchain. But, as we are seeing, everyone from Microsoft to academia 
                            are exploring the technology's potential, and its implications to disrupt their industries. 
                            It's no surprise then that blockchain is now producing real implications for the cybersecurity field.
